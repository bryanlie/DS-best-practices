## How to improve the performance

To optimize the neural network and improve the accuracy of the image classification model, we can make several modifications to the existing code. Here are some suggestions:

  - Use a more advanced architecture:
  Replace the CustomNet with a pre-trained model like ResNet or EfficientNet, which have proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks.
  - Implement learning rate scheduling:
  Use a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training, which can help in achieving better convergence and higher accuracy.
  - Add more data augmentation:
  Expand the data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
  - Increase the number of epochs:
  Train the model for more epochs to allow it to learn more complex features.
  - Use cross-validation:
  Implement k-fold cross-validation to get a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.

## Dataset

The EuroSAT dataset is a land use and land cover classification dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery[1][2]. It consists of 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced samples covering 13 spectral bands and 10 different land cover classes[1][3]. The dataset is designed to serve as a benchmark for deep learning applications in Earth observation, particularly for land use and land cover classification tasks[2][4].

Key features of the EuroSAT dataset include:

1. 10 land cover classes
2. 27,000 labeled images
3. Two versions available: RGB (3 bands) and all 13 spectral bands[1]
4. Image size of 64x64 pixels[1]
5. Freely accessible and released under the MIT license[2][3]

The EuroSAT dataset has been widely used in research and has achieved high classification accuracy, with reported results of up to 98.57% overall accuracy using state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)[2].
